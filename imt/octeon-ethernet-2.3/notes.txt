1. The following files provide:
a) PHY state machine tracing capabilities using
   # echo 0|1 > /sys/class/net/ethX/fsmtctl      -- Disable|Enable tracing
   # cat /sys/class/net/ethX/fsmtrace            -- Show the FSM trace.

b) Fix (?) for link state change (specifically, N804 bypass off) problem reported by Risk Analytics.

The files are part of the OCTEON-SDK-2.3
