The hbtool sources can be installed anywhere outside of OCTEON-SDK as standalone module or can be part of the OCTEON-SDK, e.g. located in the $OCTEON_ROOT/host directory.

The Host and Target runtime environment for hbtool -- CentOS Linux.

1. Link the module against OCTEON-SDK-2.3
$ cd <OCTEON-SDK-install-directory>
$ source env-setup OCTEON_CN66XX
This will setup several OCTEON-SDK related environment variables.

2. Compile OCTEON-SDK Remote Libarary, if it is not created yet.
The library is used by the hbtool.
$ cd $OCTEON_ROOT/host/remote-lib
$ make

2. Build the hbtool module
$ cd 
$ make clean
$ make
This will generate hbtool binary.
