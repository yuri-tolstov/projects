$ cd hello2
$ make
$ sudo insmod ./hello.ko

Now there is a device named /dev/hello that will produce "Hello, world!" when read by root:
$ sudo cat /dev/hello
Hello, world!

-------- Attempt 1:
But we can't read it as a regular user:
$ cat /dev/hello
cat: /dev/hello: Permission denied
$ ls -l /dev/hello
crw-rw---- 1 root root 10, 61 2007-06-20 14:31 /dev/hello

This is what happens with the default udev rule, which says that when a miscellaneous device appears, create a file named /dev/<device name> and give it permissions 0660 (owner and group have read-write access, everyone else has no access). We would really like instead for the device be readable by regular users and have a link to it named /dev/hello_world. In order to do this, we'll write a udev rule.

The udev rule has to do two things: create a symbolic link and change the permissions on device to make world readable. The rule that accomplishes this is:
KERNEL=="hello", SYMLINK+="hello_world", MODE="0444"

-------- Attempt 2:
Copy the hello.rules file from the hello_dev directory into the /etc/udev/ directory and create a link to it that will be executed before any other rules file:
$ sudo cp hello.rules /etc/udev/
$ sudo ln -s ../hello.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/010_hello.rules

Now, reload the hello world driver and look at the new /dev entries:
$ sudo rmmod hello_dev
$ sudo insmod ./hello_dev.ko
$ ls -l /dev/hello*
cr--r--r-- 1 root root 10, 61 2007-06-19 21:21 /dev/hello
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      5 2007-06-19 21:21 /dev/hello_world -> hello

Now we have /dev/hello_world! Finally, check that you can read the "Hello, world!" devices as a normal user:
$ cat /dev/hello_world
Hello, world!
$ cat /dev/hello
Hello, world!

NOTE: Watch uevents (e.g. module install/uninstall) using
$ udevadm monitor
