Notes:
1. i2c-dev.h is a part of the lm-sensors package.
Though, for compiling the program, the following packages have to be installed:
	ls-sensors, i2c-tools, libi2c-dev (contains i2c-dev.h), linux-headers, linux-libc-dev

2. I installed /dev/i2c-N by using:
# modprobe i2c-dev
... but, it might needs to be done explicitly like this:
# mknod /dev/i2c-0 c 89 0

3. There are two methods of reading/writhing from/to I2C devices:
a) using read()/write() functions
b) using API provided in i2c-dev.h, e.g. i2c_smbus_write_byte().
