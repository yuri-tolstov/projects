This example program demonstrates the use of compression and
decompression using the MiCA Compression shim.

See the Application Libraries Reference Guide (UG527) for more
information about the APIs used in this example.

To compile, first copy the directory to a new location. Then to
compile natively do:

  make

To cross-compile:
  TILERA_ROOT=<path_to_MDE> make

The MiCA Compression shim is not supported by the simulator.
